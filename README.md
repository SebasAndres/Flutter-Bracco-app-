# Bracco App
> A flutter app to manage a hairdressing-shop using Google Firebase.

It allows the user to register clients, types of service, appointments, workers, stores and see the stats. Therefore, whenever a client should make a visit the app will notify 
the managers and it will appear an option to send them a modeled message automatically through the Whatsapp api. 

The UI is designed so as both workers and managers can use them. The workers are able to register clients and the cuts they do. This appointment is saved in the database and then
the managers can check the cuts done per day, week, month or any other period they prefer.

Within managers section workers comision can be set and the app will automatically print the wage you should pay according to that comision. There, you can also see the stats and
the economical balance of the firm, comparing income and loss.
