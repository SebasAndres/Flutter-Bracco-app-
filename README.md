# bracco-app
A flutter app to manage a hairdressing-shop using Google Firebase.

The app allows you to register clients, types of services, workers, stores and dates. Therefore you can check whenever a client should arrange a visit and the app uses Whatsapp Api
to redirect you to send a pre-modeled message. You can also see the stats and the list of clients within a private sector only available to the manager (through a password).
The manager is also able to set the comision of each worker in every work done by them.
